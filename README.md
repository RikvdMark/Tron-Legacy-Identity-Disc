# Tron-Legacy-Identity-Disc
Repository for the Arduino sketches for my prop replica of the Tron: Legacy identity disc. Including all the test/learning stuff. Details about the project are on; 

Relevant file to use:

Please don't ask for any support, I uploaded all the version so you can slowely build it up yourself. 
Some Arduino revisions might require a few changes. best way is to build it up step-by-step should you encounter any issues you can't figure out.
For this reason I created a playlist on my YouTube channel mentioned below where I explain the different revisions and what all the relevant stuff does.

A very big thanks you to Erv Plecter. He created the disc that inspired this whole project and was kind enough to provide me with his Arduino sketch. All animation related code comes from his sketch.
